libVX - Video Extension
-----------------------

libVX is a protocol library to get raw video frames efficiently from video files
and live video sources. Unlike other libraries, it does only handle setup and
capture processing. libVX was written to serve as an abstraction layer for
video acquisition for Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Converting image
buffers is out of scope and should be done in the client code.
